Hello! This is my readme file.

Basically, to use my keyboard, press keys to make different nots. It's equal and opposite, one hand goes up, and the same key on the other hand goes down.

There are four buttons to set the pitch, and have fun from there. Included is a map of the different keys and their functions. Enjoy!
